            <h2>Why to start?</h2>
            <p>It can be especially daunting to approach teaching computer science or begin incorporating it into your classroom.
                But the benefits can be incredibly rewarding, both for you and your students. Starting one step at a time
                and knowing that you don't have to be an expert right away can put you and your students on the path to
                creating your own programs, solving rewarding problems, and gaining tech literacy in an ever-changing world.</p>
            <p>Through CS education, students can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Develop <a href="https://iste.org/courses/introduction-to-computational-thinking-for-every-educator" target="_blank">computational thinking</a> skills
                    that help students understand and communicate about math, science, language arts, and social studies.</li>
                <li>Use technology not just as consumers, but <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu" target="_blank">creators.</a></li>
                <li>Gain access to a <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-and-information-research-scientists.htm">career</a> they might be passionate about and
