            <h2>Why to start?</h2>
            <p>It can be especially difficult to approach teaching CS or begin incorporating them into your classroom.
                But the benefits can be incredibly rewarding, both for you and your students. Starting one step at a time
                and knowing that you don't have to be an expert right away can put you and your students on the path to
                creating your own programs, solving rewarding problems, and increased tech literacy in an ever-changing world.</p>
            <p>Students can:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Develop <a href="https://iste.org/courses/introduction-to-computational-thinking-for-every-educator" target="_blank">computational thinking</a> skills
                    that help students understand and communicate about math, science, language arts, and social studies.</li>
                <li>Use technology not just as consumers, but <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu" target="_blank">creators.</a></li>
                <li>Gain access to a <a href="https://www.bls.gov/ooh/computer-and-information-technology/computer-and-information-research-scientists.htm">career</a> they might be passionate about and
                    <a href="https://k12cs.org/equity-in-computer-science-education/" target="_blank">work to bridge gaps in equitable access</a> to computing.</li>

        <p>
            First, decide on a curriculum you want to start with by using the flowchart on the right:
        </p>
        <p> We pick a curriculum and stick with it for now, because we want some structure to guide us as we learn:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>CS Specific Content Knowledge</li>
            <li>CS Specific Pedagogy</li>
            <li>CS Specific Classroom Management</li>
        </ol>
